Apportable-OGL-Problem
======================

Small iOS Xcode project demonstrating a problem on Apportable build where the screen doesn't refresh.
This project can build & run on both iOS simulator and iPhone devices without problems.

Expected behavior: The screen should be shaking, it should also react to screen touches by scaling and fading out.
